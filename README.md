# **ChatApp**

## **Project Description**

This project is a chat app for mobile devices built using React Native. The app has a chat interface for users with options to share images and their location.

## Tech Used

- React Native
- Expo/Expo Go
- Android Emulator

## User Stories

- As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
  friends and family.
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
  the latest news
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
  time.
- As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
  reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

## Key Features

- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
  before joining the chat.
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
  and location data.
- Data gets stored online and offline.

- Copy the contents of the Firebase configuration (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, appId) and replace the contents in the "Chat.js" file
- From Firebase dashboard click on **Build** from left side panel, then **Authentication**, then **Set up sign-in method** and enable anonymous authentication
- From Firebase dashboard click on **Build** from left side panel, then **Storage** and create a new storage space in the same fashion you created the **Firestore Database**
